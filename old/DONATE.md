# donate

pastemyst is completely free and open source. it has no ads or premium features. because of this pastemyst by itself doesn't make any money, and unfortunately hosting a website like this costs money.

if you like pastemyst and want to support my work you can donate some money, any amount matters a lot!

here are some places you can support me on:

- [liberapay/codemyst](https://liberapay.com/codemyst)
- [patreon/codemyst](https://www.patreon.com/codemyst)
- [ko-fi/codemyst](https://ko-fi.com/codemyst)
- vultr affiliate - this is the VPS host i use, and i fully recommend them. they have excellent prices and fast support. by using my affiliate links you directly support the hosting of pastemyst.
    * you get 100$ and i get 25$: [https://www.vultr.com/?ref=8377973-6G](https://www.vultr.com/?ref=8377973-6G)
    * if that link doesn't work use this one: [https://www.vultr.com/?ref=7577110](https://www.vultr.com/?ref=7577110)

if you donate directly to pastemyst (with liberapay, patreon or ko-fi) you will get a special supporter badge on your profile for everyone to see. when you donate please email me (contact email can be found at the bottom of the page) with an image confirming your donation.

even if you can't support my work financially, i really appreciate everyone who does use pastemyst as that means that my work didn't go to waste as there are people using it!
